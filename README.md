# Figure generation code for "Imaging moiré deformation and dynamics in twisted bilayer graphene"

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks to generate the figures in ["Imaging moiré deformation and dynamics in twisted bilayer graphene"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14716).

TODO:

- Refer to archived/repository version of data instead of local paths. 
- Move .nlp's to netcdf
- Add requirements.txt
- Link archived data in here.
- add ipynb and jupytext description when done.
- Obtain DOI via zenodo.org
